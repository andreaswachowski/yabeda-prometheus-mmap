# Yabeda::[Prometheus]::Mmap


Adapter for easy exporting your collected metrics from your application to the [Prometheus]!
It is based on [Prometheus Ruby Mmap Client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/prometheus-client-mmap), that uses mmap'ed files to share metrics from multiple processes.
This allows efficient metrics processing for Ruby web apps running in multiprocess setups like Unicorn or Puma (clustered mode).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yabeda-prometheus-mmap'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

 1. Exporting from running web servers:

    Place following in your `config.ru` _before_ running your application:

    ```ruby
    require 'yabeda/prometheus/mmap'

    use Yabeda::Prometheus::Exporter
    ```

    Metrics will be available on `/metrics` path (configured by `:path` option).

    Also you can mount it in Rails application routes as standalone Rack application.

 2. Run web-server from long-running processes (delayed jobs, â€¦):

    ```ruby
    require 'yabeda/prometheus/mmap'

    Yabeda::Prometheus::Exporter.start_metrics_server!
    ```

    WEBrick will be launched in separate thread and will serve metrics on `/metrics` path.

    See [yabeda-sidekiq] for example.

    Listening address is configured via `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_BIND` env variable (default is `0.0.0.0`).

    Port is configured by `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT` or `PORT` variables (default is `9394`).


## Development with Docker

Get local development environment working and tests running is very easy with docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose run app bundle
docker-compose run app bundle exec rspec
```
